Scan Options:

1. Scan through multiple times, filter/average the data, then look for objects.

2. Scan through, anytime an object may be detected, go back and scan that area.


Object detection options:
1. Base threshold: anytime a measurement is lower than that amount, assume an object is there.
2. Slope: if the distance between values changes too sharply, assume an object is there.

Radial Width:
Determine angle where object starts.
Determine angle where object ends.
Subtract start from end.

Linear width:
